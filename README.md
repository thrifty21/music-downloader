# music-downloader

This is a script that will allow you to download music from spotify url's from your liked playlist or anywhere else from spotify.

Spotify api client credentials can be left as is or you can place in your's if you like via https://developer.spotify.com/

When initiating the script you can change the download locations. I have mine currently defaulted to my path. 

Same goes for music media types. Mp4a, mp3, flac and wav are supported. MP3 is defaulted.

Then watch the magic happen. The music wont be downloaded from spotify as this is copyright and licensing issues.

So alternative is finding the closest similar song in youtube which works almost 99% of the time.

Feel free to take and use for personal use.
